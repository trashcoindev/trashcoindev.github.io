## üî• Project Overview

**Trash Coin** is a satirical art project designed to deliver sharp criticism of contemporary consumerism, environmental pollution, and cryptocurrency bubbles through the simulation of a cryptocurrency. In a world drowning in garbage, we've created a "currency" to match.

## üé≠ Artistic Value

Trash Coin is not just a website or a simulated token, it is:

- **Social Commentary**: A critical reflection on overconsumption and digital asset bubbles
- **Visual Art**: A fusion of horror elements, ruin aesthetics, and postmodern design language
- **Conceptual Art**: An exploration of the nature of "value" and how humans deify worthless things
- **Interactive Experience**: A visual demonstration of the consequences of consumerism through falling and accumulating trash animations

## üíª Technical Features

- **Horror Theme Aesthetics**: Creating unease through fonts like Nosifer and Creepster
- **Blood Drip Animation Effects**: Key words emphasized in blood red with dripping animations
- **Trash Falling System**: Simulation of trash continuously generating and accumulating at the bottom
- **Ruin-style Text**: Creating a sense of decay through Special Elite and Sedgwick Ave Display fonts
- **Responsive Design**: Perfect adaptation to various device sizes

## üõ£Ô∏è Project Roadmap

1. **The Pile Stage**: Symbolizing the unlimited expansion of consumerism
2. **The Melt Stage**: Representing the distortion and deformation of values
3. **The Gold Illusion Stage**: Satirizing how worthless things are given false value
